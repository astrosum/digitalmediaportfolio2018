    <p>Welcome to my Digital Media Portfolio for 2018! This is my homepage. </p>
    <p>Digital Media was really fun, overall I had a great time in this class, even if I struggled a bit from the start. I'm definitely going to consider taking this class again, because I learned a lot of things I wouldn't think I needed to know, but it made my life a whole lot easier. Mr. Kapptie was a wonderful teacher and taught us everything we needed to know about computers and applications on our computers. I had a really good time and digital media was one of my favorite classes.</p>
